## Hand Gesture Recognition

Hand Gesture Recognition dataset contains images from a variety of different
hands, from different races, ages and genders, posed into Rock / Paper or
Scissors and labeled as such. 

These images have all been generated using CGI
techniques as an experiment in determining if a CGI-based dataset can be used
for classification against real images.

Note that all of this data is posed against a white background.
Dataset contains 2,892 images of diverse hands in Rock/Paper/Scissors poses
as train test and validation data.

Each image is 300Ã—300 pixels in 24-bit color.

A model that classifies the hand gestures.
